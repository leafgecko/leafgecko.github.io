About me:
Hi my friends call me Katherine or Wan Ting! I'm currently a 3rd year NTU CompEng student!
Do check out my project, NTULearn Downloader, below!

### NTULearn Downloader

This application helps you to pull and download your lecture, tutorial and even AcuLearn videos from NTU Learn Blackboard.
Other functionalities include:
- selecting which files to download
- Don't want to download a specific mod? Select files you never want to download
- Keeps track of what has been previously downloaded, so you don't download things twice
- Options to only download non-video files (Videos will, obviously, take a while)

Mac OS X GUI Download

Dear Ubuntu/Linux users, like myself, since you have already gotten into this mess, I shall limit you to the CLI version.
*CLI can be used across all OS

Since I've never taken any UI course, it's completely understandable if you have 0 idea how the heck to use the GUI.

### Support or Buy me a milkshake

I love milkshakes with a passion and I'm not being paid for this. 
If you find this useful or would like to support me, I would be eternally grateful if you could donate some moolah.

And since I've been putting my time into this instead of watching my lectures, 
might as well make the best of out this and help me to share this with any of your NTU peers!
